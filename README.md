# Udacity Trivia Flask App
 A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game. As a part of the FullStack Nanodegree, it serves as a practice module for lessons on API Development and Documentation. By completing this project I will apply the skills I learned about formatting API endpoints that leverage knowledge of HTTP and API development best practices. 

 ## Pre-requisites and Local Development
 Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip and node installed on their local machines.
